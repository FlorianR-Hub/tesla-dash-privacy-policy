		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2> 
		<p>Tesla Dash app is a Commercial app.</p> 
		<p>In this Privacy Policy, we inform you about what personal data we collect and for which purposes your data is used.</p>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">What kind of data we are gathering</h3>
		<p>When using Tesla Dash we do not record any personal data besides the named services Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics.</p>


		<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Firebase Analytics</h3>
		<p>We collect pseudonymised usage statistics concerning your use of our app using Google Firebase, a service of Google LLC (“Google”). Therefore google collects information about your use of the app. This data will be transferred and saved to a Google server in Europe (Belgium, Netherlands or Finland). Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the App, compiling reports on the app’s activities within the App for us, and providing other services relating to the use of the App and the internet. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.</p>
		<p>The data stored at Firebase Analytics is stored for a period of 14 months. After this period, Firebase Analytics only stores aggregated statistics.</p>
		<p>Firebase Analytics is used on the basis of our legitimate interest in a needs-based design, statistical evaluation and efficient advertising of our app and the fact that your legitimate interests do not predominate.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
		<p>We use Firebase Crashlytics, a service of Google LLC. Crashlytics transmits certain technical information to us concerning your device and your app installation if your app crashes. We use this data only in order to determine the reason for the crash and to remove errors in our app. This data is usually not personal data.</p>
		<p>Crashlytics is used based on our legitimate interest in recognizing errors in our app, examining them and remedying them, and to thus be able to offer our app in its contractually stipulated form, and the fact that your legitimate interests are not overriding.</p>
